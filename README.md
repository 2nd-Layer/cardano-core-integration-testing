Integration Testing for Cardano Node and associated tooling

## Cardano in [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
There is an on-going effort to place **Cardano** into classic release of openSUSE Linux distribution, development is happening in [development Open Build Service repository](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:languages:haskell:cardano). This would not be possible without [@mark-stopka](), [@mimi1vx](https://github.com/mimi1vx) and [@peti](https://github.com/peti).
